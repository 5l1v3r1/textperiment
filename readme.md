#textperiment

64k ASCII demo written in python. Features a simple canvas-like engine and a 16 colour palette.  
2nd place in the Euskal Encounter 23 Open Intro Compo

Code: Yuri Numerov (Achifaifa) -  achi <a> hush <.> ai  
Music: Stage7 - stage7 <a> stg7 <.> net

To stop the demo, use Ctrl+C (If it doesn't work, just keep it pressed).  
Music is essentially composed of bash commands. In faster computers the music track may go way, way faster than expected and the demo may look out of sync. With a 800MHz/1GB laptop running linux in tty mode works fine, but the odds are against it working in things like a dual core or higher.
